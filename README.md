SDXL Fine-Tuning for Textile Pattern Generation

This project fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion model on a custom dataset of textile patterns to improve its ability to generate detailed and high-quality designs, tailored for the fashion industry.

Objectives

1. Dataset Preparation
Collect and preprocess a diverse set of textile pattern images.
2. Model Fine-Tuning with PEFT
Fine-tune a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using PEFT techniques on the custom dataset.
3. Optimize hyperparameters to achieve efficient and effective fine-tuning.

Methodology

- Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather and preprocess textile pattern images (resize, normalize, augment).
- PEFT Fine-Tuning:
Apply PEFT to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model with minimal parameter adjustments.
- Evaluation:
Generate and evaluate textile patterns using a combination of expert ratings and objective metrics.

Results

The PEFT fine-tuned model showed significant improvements in generating detailed, high-quality textile patterns, meeting the specific needs of the fashion industry while efficiently utilizing resources.
